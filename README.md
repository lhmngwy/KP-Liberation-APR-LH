# KP Liberation APR 
This is my customised fork of Apricot_ale's Fork of KP Liberation. My fork was created for my brother and I to play, the changes are mainly to improve co-op for low player counts.

Apricot_ale's fork is a uniquely modified version of [KP Liberation](https://github.com/KillahPotatoes/KP-Liberation), incorporating several pull requests (PRs) that have already been submitted.

My customisations include:

- Updated all vanilla presets, all factions have access to all guns. Armour and vehicles are still faction restricted.
- AI squad members will now redeploy with the player.
- Added persistent vehicle cargo, fuel and damage, plus some other changes from https://github.com/moistbois/Moist-Liberation-APR
- Integrated pSiKO Ai Revive to enable AI medics to revive. This is hard coded so leave "Revive Mode" set to disabled in mission parameters: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2996342068
- Added additional map ports by stutpip123: https://github.com/KillahPotatoes/KP-Liberation/pull/854
- More changes to come...
