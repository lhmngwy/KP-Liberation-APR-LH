# KP Liberation APR 
This is my customised fork of Apricot_ale's fork of KP Liberation. My fork was created for my brother and I to play, the changes are mainly to improve co-op for low player counts.

Apricot_ale's fork is a uniquely modified version of [KP Liberation](https://github.com/KillahPotatoes/KP-Liberation), incorporating several pull requests (PRs) that have already been submitted.

My customisations include:

- Updated all vanilla presets, all factions have access to all guns. Armour and vehicles are still faction restricted.
- Blufor vehicles and HC squads will be saved anywhere on the map.
- Added persistent player squads, disconnect and reconnect and you will still have your squad!
- Redeploy from anywhere as long as there are no enemies nearby.
- AI squad members will now redeploy with the player.
- Respawning will kill your squad too, or the last HC squad you created if you have no squad. No cheesing respawns to save your squad.
- Added respawn tents (Requires Tent Backpacks mod).

Integrated from others:
